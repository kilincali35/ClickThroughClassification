Both versions use the same structure, a NestedCV approach to evaluate generalization perfomrance of the model. 

In V1, i used a SGD Classifier to have a quick solution from a large dataset. V2 is for XGBoost boosting algorithm, it significantly increased the performance of the model, but it was slower than the first model.
